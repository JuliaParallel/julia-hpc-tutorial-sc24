ml load julia

# NOTE: because the `solution folder is at a deeper level from the project root
# as the excercise, we've added an additional `/..` to get back to the
# `activate.sh`
source ../../../activate.sh

# Run the Julia code -- we're usign `srun` to launch Julia. This is necessary
# to configure MPI. If you tried to use `MPI.Init()` outside of an srun, then
# the program will crash. Note also that you can't run an srun _insite_ of
# another srun.

# NOTE: when you specify --ntasks or --ntasks-per-node in the jobscript header,
# then srun inherits these. The command below is equivalent to: `srun -n 16`
srun julia hello_world.jl
